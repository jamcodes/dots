- [ ] Consider adding the capslock-escape/ctrl mode, based on the following:
      > Step 1. Install XCAPE
        Install XCAPE (xcape). (Linux utility to configure modifier keys to act as other keys when pressed and released on their own.)

        Ubuntu:

        sudo apt-get install xcape
        Step 2. Run the command
        # make CapsLock behave like Ctrl:
        setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps

        # make short-pressed Ctrl behave like Escape:
        xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape'
