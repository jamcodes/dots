# My desktop setup dotfiles

## Howto

The setup is based on `i3wm` or `i3-gaps` and the `fish` shell.
Check the `scripts` directory. Assuming you already installed the build-essential tools, the scripts of interest are:
* `install_fish.sh`,
* `install_hasklig.sh`,
* `install_i3wm.sh`,
Hopefully each should be self explenatory.

Also checkout
* `.xprofile` - multi-monitor config. Run `xrandr` and adopt to your detected screens.
* `.Xresources` - rofi conifg.
